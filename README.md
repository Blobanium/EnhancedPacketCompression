This mod enhances network efficiency by providing control over packet compression levels.

Vanilla Minecraft servers compress packets exceeding a specific size threshold to help conserve bandwidth and improve connectivity for players with slower connections. The 'network-compression-threshold' setting in the 'server.properties' file manages this behavior.

This mod offers further optimization by allowing you to adjust the packet compression level. This capability can potentially reduce CPU load at the very slight cost of some network bandwidth, given everything is configured correctly. Servers with large player counts can particularly benefit from this customization.

While this mod is designed for servers, this mod can technically run client-side, however running it client-sided isn't recommended as this mod does have the slight potential of triggering anti-cheats as this mod does "modify packets" in a way.

That being said this mod can be run completely server-side and vanilla clients can join thanks to how minecraft's network compression works.
